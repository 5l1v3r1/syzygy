This directory contains test data.

Minidumps
=========
These dumps were created using WinDbg and running c:\windows\system32\notepad
and c:\windows\syswow64\notepad.exe.

The dump configurations were based off Chrome's configurations. See
chromium/src/components/crash/app/breakpad_win.cc&l=69 for details.

WinDbg (X86 for 32bit dumps, X64 for 64 bit dumps) commandlines for generating
the dumps:
 - Small type: '.dump /mup <path>'
 - Larger Type: '.dump /mupi <path>'

DLLs and PDBs
=============
- test_types* were generated in release mode
- test_typenames* were generated in debug mode to simplify type_namer_unittest.
      Basic types are part the global scope in debug mode (which makes writing
      the test easier), but not in release mode.
